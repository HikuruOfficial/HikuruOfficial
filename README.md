## Discover Hikuru: your one-stop ecosystem in Web3

Hikuru is an advanced decentralized Web3 ecosystem that offers a range of decentralized applications with Social-Fi elements. Users will be able to communicate with each other in any of our ecosystem projects while maintaining anonymity. What sets Hikuru apart is its unique commission distribution model - a **generous 50% commission** is paid to users who expand our community by inviting new members to the platform.

## Solving the crypto-enthusiast's dilemma: time and availability

At the heart of Hikuru's innovation is a solution to a critical problem: saving time and improving current technology. We realize that crypto-enthusiasts need a single platform that offers comprehensive and secure crypto solutions. We will create improved decentralized applications that allow users to be more active in the Web3 world. Everything you are using now is an unfinished platforms, and in turn, we will introduce functionality you haven't seen yet.

## The commission distribution is 50%

Hikuru is your gateway to the world of blockchain where every invitation has value. We are excited to offer you a unique opportunity to be part of our growing community and be rewarded for expanding that community. For every user brought into our ecosystem through your unique link, we will charge you a commission of 50% of the amount spent by the user you invited on ecosystem Hikuru. This is our recognition of your contribution to the platform. This means that a portion of the project's revenue is directly returned to you as a thank you for your activism and support for the development of our community.

Why split your attention between hundreds of projects when Hikuru offers everything you need in a single, secure, decentralized ecosystem? Our vision is broad and inclusive - an ecosystem that works across all blockchain networks. We are currently laying the foundation on the Blast blockchain, which we have defined as our core blockchain for developing decentralized applications.

## Social-Fi elements in every ecosystem app

At the heart of our ecosystem lies an innovative approach to social interactions, integrating Social-Fi principles with every aspect of our applications. At Hikuru, we're not just creating a platform—we're creating a space where everyone can freely communicate, express their thoughts and ideas through personalized profiles and posts. You'll be able to interact with our social chain in each of our ecosystem applications without having to open extra pages or leave your workspace. But this is just the beginning.

We offer a unique opportunity for each user not only to share their thoughts but also to become part of an economic network, buying and selling shares of both their own profile and those of other users. This opens up new horizons for interaction and investment within our decentralized network.

Our applications provide a platform for creating and deepening social connections, while also enabling direct economic participation and influence by each participant. At Hikuru, you will find not only the means for communication but also the tools to realize your economic potential. Welcome to the next-generation social network, where every interaction holds value.
