## Discover Hikuru: your one-stop ecosystem in Web3

Hikuru is an advanced decentralized Web3 ecosystem that offers a range of decentralized applications with Social-Fi elements. Users will be able to communicate with each other in any of our ecosystem projects while maintaining anonymity. What sets Hikuru apart is its unique commission distribution model - a **generous 50% commission** is paid to users who expand our community by inviting new members to the platform.

## Solving the crypto-enthusiast's dilemma: time and availability

At the heart of Hikuru's innovation is a solution to a critical problem: saving time and improving current technology. We realize that crypto-enthusiasts need a single platform that offers comprehensive and secure crypto solutions. We will create improved decentralized applications that allow users to be more active in the Web3 world. Everything you are using now is an unfinished platforms, and in turn, we will introduce functionality you haven't seen yet.

## The commission distribution is 50%

What sets Hikuru apart is our reward model where 50% of the project's revenue go to users who contribute to the growth of our community through recruiting new members. This model incentivizes everyone from regular users to projects to influencers to actively recruit new members to our community, ensuring that everyone benefits from commissions earned in the Hikuru ecosystem. We give a portion of the money earned from commissions to the community, in our case decentralization and community rewards are not just promises, they are the foundation of our project and how it will work.


## Social-Fi elements and share model

At the heart of our ecosystem lies an innovative approach to social interactions, integrating Social-Fi principles with every aspect of our applications. At Hikuru, we're not just creating a platform—we're creating a space where everyone can freely communicate, express their thoughts and ideas through personalized profiles and posts. You'll be able to interact with our social chain in each of our ecosystem applications without having to open extra pages or leave your workspace. But this is just the beginning.

We offer a unique opportunity for each user not only to share their thoughts but also to become part of an economic network, buying and selling shares of both their own profile and those of other users. This opens up new horizons for interaction and investment within our decentralized network.

Our applications provide a platform for creating and deepening social connections, while also enabling direct economic participation and influence by each participant. At Hikuru, you will find not only the means for communication but also the tools to realize your economic potential. Welcome to the next-generation social network, where every interaction holds value.
